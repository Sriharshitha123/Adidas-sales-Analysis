### Step-by-Step Insights

#### Introduction
The objective of this project was to analyze Adidas' sales data using Power BI, with a focus on deriving actionable insights regarding retailer performance, sales methods, and product categories.

#### Data Processing

  - Total Sales: $899.90M
  - Total Profit: $332.13M
  - Average Price per Unit: $90.43

- **Retailer Performance**:
  - The analysis highlighted West Gear as the top-performing retailer with $86M in profit. Other significant retailers included Amazon and Foot Locker.

- **Sales Methods**:
  - The most successful sales method was in-store purchases, accounting for $356.64M in sales. Online and outlet sales also contributed significantly, with $295.59M and $247.67M, respectively.

- **Regional Sales**:
  - The West region led in sales with $269.94M, followed by the Northeast and Southeast regions. This geographic analysis provided insights into regional market strengths and opportunities.

- **Product Analysis**:

- Expand product lines in top-selling categories, particularly Men's Street Footwear, to boost sales.

#### Future Recommendations
To ensure sustained growth and market competitiveness, we recommend continuous monitoring of sales trends and the implementation of tailored marketing strategies for different regions and retailers. Additionally, exploring potential growth areas in underperforming regions and categories will help in optimizing overall sales performance.
